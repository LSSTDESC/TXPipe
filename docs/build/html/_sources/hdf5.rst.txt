Reading HDF5 Files
==================

Overview
--------

Many TXPipe outputs are in the HDF5 format. This is a fast and flexible file type that can also be easily read/written in parallel.

HDF5 files contain three types of object:

* ``datasets`` are equivalent to saved numpy arrays.
* ``groups`` are like directories and can contain datasets or sub-groups.
* ``attributes`` are for small pieces of metadata, and a set of attributes can convert to a python dictionary. They can be attached to whole files or to individual groups or datasets.

The name scheme for datasets and groups is the same a for Unix files and folders, e.g. ``f['group/subgroup/dataset']``.

From the command line, you can use the ``h5ls`` command to list the contents of an HDF5 file::

    h5ls -r filename.hdf5

h5py
----

In python, you read these files with the ``h5py`` library. Here's an example opening one of the files generated by the example "laptop" pipeline in TXPipe::

    import h5py
    f = h5py.File("./data/example/outputs/shear_tomography_catalog.hdf5")

    # Print out the items in the root of the file
    print(f.keys())
    # prints <KeysViewHDF5 ['metacal_response', 'provenance', 'tomography']>
    # showing the three groups generated by tomography stage


We can create variables to represent groups in the file::

    g = f["tomography"]
    print(g.keys())
    # prints <KeysViewHDF5 ['N_eff', 'N_eff_2d', 'mean_e1', 'mean_e1_2d', 'mean_e2', 'mean_e2_2d', 'sigma_e', 'sigma_e_2d', 'source_bin', 'source_counts', 'source_counts_2d']>


Printing a dataset doesn't load it, it just shows the size and type of the data::

    print(g["mean_e1"])
    # prints <HDF5 dataset "mean_e1": shape (4,), type "<f4">


Instead we load data sets as a numpy arrays with a slice::

    e = g["mean_e1"][:]
    print(e)
    # prints [ 0.00283134 -0.0140038   0.0011645  -0.01299088]

For longer arrays we may want to just read a subset of the data::

    b = g["source_bins"][0:100]

Attributes
----------

The easiest way to read attributes from h5py is to turn them into a dictionary::

    d = dict(f['provenance'].attrs)
    print(d)
    # prints lots of provenance tracking information like all the package versions
    # and configuration options
