Conda Installation
==================

You can get a complete, isolated, environment from scratch that can run TXPipe on a laptop or desktop using this command on Mac or Linux: 

.. code-block:: bash

    ./bin/install.sh


Then whenever you start a new terminal, enable the system with:

.. code-block:: bash

    source ./conda/bin/activate
