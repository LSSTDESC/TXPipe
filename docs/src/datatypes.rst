Data Type Classes
=================

TXPipe stage input and output files are all represented by a class which defines their type and various other pieces of information.

Some of these classes are generic, like :py:class:`~txpipe.data_types.base.HDFFile` or :py:class:`~txpipe.data_types.base.TextFile`, and some are more specific, like :py:class:`~txpipe.data_types.types.ShearCatalog`.

The available types are described below.
