TXPipe Installation
===================

Requirements
------------

TXPipe requires python 3.6 or above.

As the pipeline has many components it has many dependencies. These are listed in the file ``requirements.txt``, but getting an environment which can run the code fully parallel requires care.


- `Conda Installation`_ is the easiest approach on a personal machine
- `NERSC Shifter Installation`_ is the easiest approach on NERSC
- `CC-IN2P3 Installation`_ for the French CC-IN2P3 machine

The last is probably easiest to adapt to other clusters or supercomputer.
