Random Catalogs
===============

The random catalogs match the tomography of the lens sample. Two random  catalogs are generated, one with a much smaller sample size, suitable for use when measuring the density-density correlation, and a larger one suitable for measuring the lensing-density cross-signal.  The smaller catalog has the suffix "_sub".
