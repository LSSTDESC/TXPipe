TXPipe Installation
==========

Requirements
------------

TXPipe requires python 3.6 or above.

The pipeline software ceci that TXPipe uses can be installed with::

    pip install ceci

Various stages of TXPipe also require::

    numpy
    scipy
    fitsio
    healpy
    astropy


which can all also be installed with pip.

To run the example you need some input data files.  You can obtain these from 
NERSC if you have access to the LSST space using::

    scp USERNAME@cori.nersc.gov:/global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/users/zuntz/data/* ./


To set up an environment with the required dependencies for this code on the cori machine at NERSC
you can run::

    source /global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/users/zuntz/setup-cori
    # OR
    source /global/projecta/projectdirs/lsst/groups/WL/users/zuntz/setup-cori-nompi

use the former when running jobs and the latter on the login nodes.
