class TXShearCalibration(PipelineStage):
    """Split the shear catalog into calibrated bins

    This class runs after source selection has been done, because the final
    calibration factor can only be estimated once we have read the entire catalog
    and chosen tomographic bins (since it is an ensemble average of cal factors).

    Once that stage has run and computed both the tomographic bin for each sample
    and the calibration factors, this stage takes the full catalog and splits it
    into one HDF5 group per bin.  This has several advantages:
    - all the calibration can happen in one place rather than
      differently in real space and Fourier
    - we can load just the galaxies we want for a single bin in later TreeCorr
      stages, rather than loading the full catalog and then splitting and calibrating
      it.
    - the low_mem option in TreeCorr can be used because the catalogs are on disc
      and contiguous.
    - it opens up other memory saving options planned for TreeCorr.

    We are not (yet) saving per-patch catalogs for TreeCorr here. We might want to
    do that later.
