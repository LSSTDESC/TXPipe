clmm
----

These stages are for locating catalogs of background galaxies for mass modelling.  It is designed to make inputs to CLMM.


cluster_mag
-----------

These stages are for doing tangential shear measurements around clusters directly, not using CLMM.

They are older and may not be useful, so are not imported automatically.


twopoint_scia
-------------
This stage is for the self-calibration intrinsic alignments project.
