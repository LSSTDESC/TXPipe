pipeline_binned.yml
	- linear regression on the binned density vs SP map plots 
	- Fits to all maps with null trend p-value < threshold

pipeline_pix_lin.yml
	- linear regression on the healpix pixel density vs SP value 
	- Fits to all maps with binned null trend p-value < threshold

pipeline_pix_enet.yml
	- linear regression on the healpix pixel density vs SP value 
	- Fits to all maps, regularisation is done with the scikit learn ENET implementation
