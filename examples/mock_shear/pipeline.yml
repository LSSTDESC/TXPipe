stages:
  - name: TXSimpleMock             # Convert a text file mock catalog to HDF5
  - name: TXSourceSelectorSimple   # select and split objects into source bins
  - name: TXShearCalibration       # Calibrate and split the source sample tomographically
  - name: TXMockTruthPZ            # Generate PDFs as narrow gaussian centered on the true redshifts
